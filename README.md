<h4>This React Native app connects to a Flask API that uses a CNN model to predict the name of plant diseases and their corresponding cures. The app allows users to take or select an image of a plant and send it to the API, which then processes the image and returns the disease and cure information. The app provides a user-friendly interface for users to easily access this information.</h4>
